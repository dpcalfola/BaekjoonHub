"""
I spent about four hours without rest solving this problem
Even though the problem is Bronze 3 difficulty

However, I am so satisfied with today's coding
Because I learned and exercised so many things about Python OOP
Especially, I understood these lists of skills more deeply
    - Class inheritance,
    - Abstract method with annotation,
    - Getter and Setter annotation,
    - etc.

Also, I've got the point about the Similarity between Python Dictionary and JSON.
Awesome !!

Although, for making clean code, here,
there's almost code wear deleted that connected with them.
But I leave this message to express my feeling of exaltation

Happy developing !!
